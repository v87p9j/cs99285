Outputs from you model should include:· Total boxes shipped from each Supply Point· Total boxes shipped to each Transshipment Center· Total boxes shipped from each Transshipment Center· Total boxes shipped to each Demand Point· Total cost
Set all Decision Variables (shipment quantities) to 1. (Setting all DVs to 1 is a smart way to check model calculations; it is called “The Ones Test”.)B. Feasibility: Two proposed shipping plans are provided. Does the plan satisfy Bloomex’s business needs? Is anything strange about the plan? (Don’t worry about whether the plan is “smart”, just does it “work”?) Show your work. 
Remember: Evaluative Model, NO OPTIMIZATION AT THIS TIME!
